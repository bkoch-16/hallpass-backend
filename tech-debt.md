# Tech Debt

Grouped by unit of work — items in the same section share a root cause or a
touch surface and should be fixed together. Severity: 🔴 breaks in production ·
🟠 real bug, bounded blast radius · 🟡 consistency / latent.

Source: repo review 2026-07-09 (supersedes the deleted `tech-debt.md`; overlaps
with `docs/audit-2026-07-06.md`, re-verified against `develop`).

## 1. User onboarding — bulk-student delivery 🟡

Touches `apps/user-api/src/routes/user.ts`. Provisioning itself is solved
(`createUserWithCredential`); see `docs/ONBOARDING.md`.

- **No mechanism to deliver credentials at scale.** `POST /api/users/bulk`
  returns a `created`/`failed` summary, not the per-student temp passwords, so
  there's no way to get a credential to each student. A set-password link or
  transactional-email invite is still needed before onboarding a school at scale
  — see the "Future optimizations" (set-password link, transactional email) in
  `docs/ONBOARDING.md`.

## 2. Cross-service invariants (schools-api ↔ passes-api) 🟡

No layer owns the invariants passes-api depends on. The sharp destination case
is now closed; what remains is the bounded-staleness case below.

- ✅ **RESOLVED — destination delete guards in-flight passes.** `DELETE
  /destinations/:id` (`apps/schools-api/src/routes/destination.ts`) now returns
  `409` while a non-terminal (`PENDING`/`WAITING`/`ACTIVE`) pass references the
  destination, and `promoteFromQueue` (`apps/passes-api/src/lib/slots.ts:197-198`)
  filters `destination: { deletedAt: null }` — a WAITING student can no longer be
  promoted into a soft-deleted destination. Mirrors the `scheduleType` DELETE
  guard (`scheduleType.ts:115-122`).
- **`maxOccupancy` shrink / period `endTime` edit leave stale state.** Redis
  counters and already-armed expiry timers aren't updated until the scheduled
  reconcile. Acceptable *if* reconcile runs frequently — write that assumption
  down (`docs/INFRA.md`) rather than leaving it implicit.

---

## 3. Validation & data integrity 🟠

- ✅ **RESOLVED — timezone is validated at the schema edge.** `createSchoolSchema`
  / `updateSchoolSchema` (`apps/schools-api/src/schemas/school.ts`) now `refine`
  `timezone` against `Intl.supportedValuesOf("timeZone")`, so a bad zone is
  rejected with `422` before the row is written. This closes the downstream
  `RangeError` family in passes-api (`tzOffsetMs` / `localMidnightAsUTC`,
  `apps/passes-api/src/lib/time.ts:30-56`) — no more 500-after-insert on pass
  creation or in quota checks.
- ✅ **RESOLVED — bulk calendar upsert is atomic.**
  `apps/schools-api/src/routes/calendar.ts` now validates every referenced
  `scheduleTypeId` up front in a single query (also killing the N+1) and returns
  `422` before any write, then performs all upserts inside one
  `prisma.$transaction` — so a bad id mid-batch leaves no partial state.
- **Quota check is read-then-write (TOCTOU).** `apps/passes-api/src/routes/passes.ts:180-203`:
  concurrent create/complete cycles can exceed `maxPerInterval` by one. The
  partial unique index bounds it to one extra — acceptable, but note it.
- **Bulk calendar `created`/`updated` counts are read-then-write (TOCTOU).**
  `apps/schools-api/src/routes/calendar.ts:103-117`: the count split is derived
  from an `existingDates` snapshot read *outside* the `$transaction`, so a
  concurrent insert of one of those dates makes the response report `created`
  where the upsert actually did an update. The write stays correct and idempotent
  — only the advisory counts can be wrong, and only under concurrent bulk writes
  to the same school's calendar (admin-only, rare). Same class as the quota
  TOCTOU above; both would be closed by a shared serializable-tx-with-retry
  helper. Exact counts otherwise need raw `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT ... RETURNING
  (xmax = 0)` (the model has no `createdAt`/`updatedAt` to compare).

## 4. Consistency & service drift 🟡

The three apps are copy-paste siblings diverging; converge in
`@hallpass/express-middleware`.

- `passes-api/app.ts` lacks the explicit `app.options` preflight handler the
  other two register; PORT env schemas differ across apps.
- `GET /passes` orders by `id asc` (`passes.ts:325`) — a live pass board wants
  newest/in-flight first; awkward to retrofit onto cursor pagination later.
- Socket auth swallows DB errors as "Unauthorized" (`apps/passes-api/src/lib/socket.ts:42-44`)
  while the HTTP path surfaces them as 500 — same inconsistency the HTTP auth fix
  already removed.
- Status-code conventions drift: school-not-found is 404 in policy PUT but 422 in
  pass create; `requireSchool` uses 422 where 403 is arguable. Pick one
  convention, document it.
- **Partial unique index landmine.** `one_active_pass_per_student` exists only in
  a migration; the schema comment (`packages/db/prisma/schema.prisma:188-197`)
  warns every `prisma migrate dev` regenerates a `DROP INDEX` that must be
  hand-deleted. passes-api's 409 duplicate-pass contract silently degrades if
  applied. Add a CI grep / post-migrate assertion so the failure is loud.
- **Integration suites collide on one shared Postgres.** Each app pins
  `fileParallelism: false` (`apps/*/vitest.integration.config.ts`), so a suite is
  serial *within itself* — but `pnpm turbo test:integration` runs all three apps'
  vitest processes concurrently against the same DB, and their `deleteMany`
  teardowns trip FK/contention errors. Every suite passes in isolation; the
  combined run flakes. Give each app its own database/schema, run the turbo task
  with `--concurrency=1`, or isolate teardown per-suite.
